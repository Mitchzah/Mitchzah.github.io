The idea for Shorts Jam was born from a simple observation: we're more connected than ever, yet we scroll alone.

During the pandemic, we watched friends and family consume endless hours of YouTube Shorts in isolation. While the algorithm is great at personalizing content, it creates echo chambers and eliminates the shared experience of discovering content together. We asked ourselves: What if watching short-form content could be as social as watching a movie together?

Traditional watch parties focus on long-form content, but short-form videos present unique challenges: rapid content switching, diverse preferences, and the need for real-time synchronization. We wanted to solve this.

Skills Utilized:
    Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
    Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
    Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time + Edge Functions)
    Video: YouTube IFrame Player API
    State Management: React hooks + Supabase subscriptions

We built a fully functional, real-time social experience from scratch in record time. Shorts Jam proves that technology can enhance human connection rather than isolate us. Every feature was designed with one question: "Does this bring people closer together?"

The answer? Yes.
