Some folks think:

- I am really good at Computers.
  - Reality: I have always been computing, still learning eveeryday :-)
- I like building things.
  - Reality: I love my Lego Ninjago builds.
- I am easy to find at a volleyball game.
  - Reality: I supply alot of energy on the court! 

To be honest, I try to learn as much as I possibly can everyday.
